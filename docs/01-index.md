title: Pattern Lib
---

All component based readme files need to be named `component-name>--<variant-name>.readme.md` to be found easily using fuzzy search.

# Todo
- [ ] Styling for the Pattern Lib itself
- [ ] Add a shit ton of inclusivity first component patterns
- [ ] Fix `Did you forget to signal async completion?`
